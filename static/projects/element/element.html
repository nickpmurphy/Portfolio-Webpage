    <span> This was a project I spent the better part of 6 weeks on with two other partners. 
        I learned a lot about debugging code and solving problems efficiently during this project.

    <span> I also learned a lot about what it means to work with a team. This project was assigned right during the pandemic and we ended up doing all of the work remotely. 
        Github is a fantastic tool for a multitude of different reasons, and has a lot of real-world applications. 
        Though this was defintely not my first time using Github, I came to value it as a tool much more after completion of our Element AI.
