    COVID-19 proved to be an interesting thing to study, and a few of my professors pounced on the oppurtunity.
    Our midterm project consisted of building a small simulator, nothing that was necessarily visually accurate, but a good simulator nonetheless.
    The program asks the user to enter a population size. Once the program is triggered, the population is represented onscreen as bouncing balls. 
    One ball is red (infected) while the rest are black (healthy). When the infected ball touches a healthy one, the healthy ball turns infected and begins infecting others.

    The simulation is rather interesting, as it shows just how quickly things spread from contact. An interesting observance from the simulator suggested the larger the population, the quicker the spread of the virus. 
    the library hosted internally on Tonbo's GitHub.
