        I shot this video as a school project, but it quickly became much more than that. The protagonist, Ron Harris, is my former boss and the chemistry can be felt through the short.
        Ron wanted a video that showcased his personality, and his store's ambience. 
        The video was posted on Instagram and earned almost 2k views; it was the most engaged post Ron has ever shared.

            I've been building a skill for cinematography my entire life, this was a great way to help give back to someone who taught me a lot, as well as showcase what I've learned.
